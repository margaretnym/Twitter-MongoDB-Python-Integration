# Twitter-MongoDB-Python-Integration
Example adapted from Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney (the example in the book used the old Twitter Search API)

This example shows how to connect to MongoDB using Python, query and store tweets in MongoDB relating to the keyword of 'python', load these JSON results into a data frame and display the data frame.
